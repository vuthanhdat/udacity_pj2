Assuming the system handles about 600 requests per second, it is using 30 ec2s, each ec2 processing 20 requests per second. 
To reduce costs, we will reduce the number of ec2 of the web server and application server by half. 
Similarly, the number of requests per second decreases, so the DB will switch to using m6i.2xlarge and reduce storage to 2000gb. 
This reduction will reduce system performance but operation will still be stable.
