In the case cost of 20k USD per month, I will revise the architecture to add disaster recovery in the US East (Ohio) region. 
This will increase the cost of infra in the second region and the cost of route 53, the cost of sync-up data to the US East (Ohio) region.
In addition, I will upgrade DB server to m6i.12xlarge, and update EBS from General Purpose SSD (gp2) to Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) instance to increase performance for the entire system.
